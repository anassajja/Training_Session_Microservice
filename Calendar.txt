Step 5: Implement the calendar integration and notification system

This step involves integrating with a calendar service (e.g., Google Calendar, Microsoft Calendar) and setting up a notification system to inform users about upcoming sessions. The implementation details will depend on the specific calendar and notification services you choose to integrate with.
You can create a new package called calendar or notification to handle these functionalities, and update the Session model and the session-related controllers accordingly.
Step 6: Add tests for the scheduling feature
In the tests package, create a new file called session_controller_test.go and add tests for the createSession() and updateSession() handlers.
