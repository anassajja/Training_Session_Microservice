# Go Microservice with MongoDB

This repository contains a Go microservice using the Gin framework and MongoDB. The microservice provides basic CRUD operations for managing users and includes several controllers for various functionalities.

## Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (version 1.18 or later)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (installed and running)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [curl](https://curl.se/) or [PowerShell's `Invoke-RestMethod`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview)

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anassajja/Training_Session_Microservice.git
cd Training_Session_Microservice
```

### Setup Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017
```

### Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the required Go packages:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

## Run the Server

Start the server by running:

```bash
go run cmd/main.go
```

The server should now be running on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

### Testing the API

Recommended to test API endpoints using Postman tool.

#### Test GET Users

Retrieve a list of users:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/users
```

Or in PowerShell:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Get -Uri http://localhost:8080/users
```

#### Test POST User

Create a new user:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/users \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name": "John Doe", "email": "john.doe@example.com"}'
```

Or in PowerShell:

```powershell
$body = @{
    name  = "John Doe"
    email = "john.doe@example.com"
}
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri http://localhost:8080/users -Body ($body | ConvertTo-Json) -ContentType "application/json"
```
